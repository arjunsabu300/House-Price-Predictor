# 🏡 **House Cost Predictor** 💰

## 📜 **Project Description**

Welcome to the **House Cost Predictor**! This web application allows users to predict the price of a house based on various features such as the number of bedrooms, bathrooms, living area, lot size, and more. Whether you're a real estate agent, homebuyer, or developer, this tool helps estimate the value of a property quickly.

The backend of the app is powered by a **machine learning model** built with **Python**, while the frontend is developed using **React**. The server-side is handled using **Node.js**, which connects the React app to the Python model via API calls.

### **How It Works**

1. **Frontend (React)**: Users input property details into a sleek, responsive form.
2. **Backend (Node.js)**: The Node.js server sends the user data to the Python machine learning model.
3. **Machine Learning (Python)**: The model processes the input and returns the predicted price.
4. **Display**: The predicted price is then displayed on the frontend for the user.

## 🔧 **Features**

* 🚀 **Real-time Price Prediction**: Predict house prices instantly based on user inputs.
* 🎨 **Interactive UI**: Built with **React** and enhanced with animations from **Framer Motion**.
* 📱 **Responsive Design**: Works smoothly on mobile, tablet, and desktop.
* 🧠 **Machine Learning Model**: Powered by a trained Python model to predict house prices.
* ⚙️ **Seamless Integration**: **Node.js** acts as a bridge between the frontend and backend for smooth API communication.

## 💻 **Technologies Used**

### **Frontend**

* **React.js**: For building the interactive user interface.
* **Framer Motion**: For adding engaging animations and transitions.
* **Axios**: For making HTTP requests to the backend API.

### **Backend**

* **Node.js**: For handling HTTP requests, routing, and interacting with the Python model.
* **Express.js**: Lightweight framework for setting up API routes.

### **Machine Learning**

* **Python**: For training the model and making predictions.
* **scikit-learn**: For creating and training the machine learning model.
* **joblib**: For saving and loading the trained model.

## 🛠 **Setup & Installation**

### **Step 1: Clone the repository**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/house-cost-predictor.git
cd house-cost-predictor
```

### **Step 2: Setup the Backend (Node.js)**

1. Navigate to the **backend** directory:

   ```bash
   cd backend
   ```

2. Install the required **Node.js** dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Run the server:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

   The server will be running on `http://localhost:5000`.

### **Step 3: Setup the Frontend (React)**

1. Navigate to the **frontend** directory:

   ```bash
   cd frontend
   ```

2. Install the required **React** dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the React development server:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

   The React app will be running on `http://localhost:3000`.

### **Step 4: Setup Python & Machine Learning Model**

1. Install the required **Python** dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. Ensure the Python server is properly configured to handle requests from Node.js.

### **Step 5: Test the Application**

After setting up everything, open your browser and go to `http://localhost:3000` or access the [live demo](https://house-price-predictor-rho.vercel.app/).
